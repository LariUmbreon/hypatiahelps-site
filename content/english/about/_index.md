## Who We Are

In 2016, we started as a group named Hypatia Software Organization. Our goal back then was simple: Provide peer mentorship to those
in the trans community who have been disenfranchised. Since then, we have learned much about providing peer support and direct
mutual aid in the form of Emergency Cash Relief.

Hypatia Helps is the next iteration of the original mission with less focus on technology, and a bigger focus on each other.
We now seek to expand our mission to help provide peer-mentorship to trans people in need.
